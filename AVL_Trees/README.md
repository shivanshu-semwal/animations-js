# AVL_Trees
### Basic implementation of AVL trees
Click on canvas to randomly add a node to the AVL tree or input a string of values seperated by spaces to enter the values into the tree sequentially or one value at a time.
### Run: 
 - Run index.html (I recommend to use a LiveServer to run index.html on `localhost` (sometimes p5JS doesn't loadup correctely on raw index.html))
 
 :)
